*   **FR-UA-003: User Account Creation/Linking:**
    *   Upon successful first-time authentication, a basic user profile associated with the Steam ID should be implicitly created or prepared in the application's backend (if data storage for users is part of MVP, see section 6.2).
    *   If the application stores user-specific data (e.g., preferences, tracked players - though these are future considerations), this Steam ID will be the primary key. For MVP, it might simply be used to associate API calls with the logged-in user.
*   **FR-UA-004: Session Management:**
    *   Upon successful login, a persistent session should be established for the user.
    *   The application must provide a clear indication of the logged-in user (e.g., displaying Steam persona name and avatar).
*   **FR-UA-005: Logout:** Users must be able to log out of the application. This action should terminate their current session.
*   **FR-UA-006: Data Association (Implicit):** While full personalization is a future consideration, logging in allows the system to potentially:
    *   Default player searches to the logged-in user's profile.
    *   Make API calls on behalf of the user if the external Dota 2 APIs require or benefit from user authentication (most public data APIs do not require user context for fetching general data but might for user-specific actions if those APIs supported them).
*   **FR-UA-007: Privacy Considerations:**
    *   Users should be informed that the application is requesting their public Steam ID for identification.
    *   The application should only request the minimum necessary information from Steam (i.e., Steam ID).

#### 3.4.2. User Interface (UI) Considerations
*   **Clear "Login with Steam" Button:** A prominently displayed and recognizable "Login with Steam" button.
*   **User Profile Display:** After login, display the user's Steam persona name and avatar in a consistent location (e.g., header).
*   **Logout Button:** An easily accessible logout option.
*   **Feedback Messages:** Clear messages for successful login, logout, and any authentication errors.

#### 3.4.3. Data Requirements
*   **User Steam ID (64-bit):** The primary identifier obtained from Steam.
*   **User Persona Name and Avatar URL:** Fetched from Steam for display purposes.
*   **Session Token:** For managing user sessions.
*   **Data Source:** Steam Web API (for OpenID authentication and fetching basic profile info like persona name/avatar post-authentication).

### 3.5. External Interfaces
The application will interact with several external APIs to fetch Dota 2 data. Rate limiting, API key management, and error handling for these external services are critical.

#### 3.5.1. Steam Web API
*   **Purpose:** Primarily used for user authentication (if implemented via Steam OpenID), resolving vanity URLs to Steam IDs, and fetching basic player profile information like persona name and avatar.
*   **Data Points:** Steam ID, persona name, avatar URL, profile visibility.
*   **Considerations:** Requires an API key. Rate limits apply. User authentication via Steam OpenID is a common pattern.

#### 3.5.2. OpenDota API / Stratz API (or other Dota 2 data APIs)
*   **Purpose:** These are the primary sources for comprehensive Dota 2 data, including player match history, detailed match statistics, hero information, item data, and aggregated statistics (e.g., hero win rates, item popularity).
*   **Data Points:**
    *   Player statistics: MMR (if public), win/loss records, hero performance, match history.
    *   Match details: Scores, player KDA, items, GPM/XPM, net worth/XP graphs, ability builds, objective timings (Roshan, towers).
    *   Hero metadata: Abilities, talents, base stats, roles.
    *   Item metadata: Costs, effects.
    *   Public match data for analysis and trends.
*   **Considerations:**
    *   Both OpenDota and Stratz offer extensive free tiers but have rate limits.
    *   The choice between them (or using both) might depend on specific data availability, data freshness, rate limit policies, and ease of integration.
    *   Data consistency and accuracy are dependent on these third-party providers.
    *   Caching strategies will be essential to manage API call volume and improve application responsiveness.

*   **NFR-USA-004: User Satisfaction (Subjective):** The application should be generally pleasant and non-frustrating to use. This can be gauged through user feedback post-launch.

### 5.6. Maintainability
*   **NFR-MAI-001: Code Quality:** Code should be well-structured, commented where necessary, and follow consistent coding standards to facilitate understanding and modification.
*   **NFR-MAI-002: Modularity:** The application should be designed in a modular way to allow for easier updates, bug fixes, and feature additions to individual components.
*   **NFR-MAI-003: Testability:** Components should be designed to be testable. Automated tests (unit, integration) should be considered to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
*   **NFR-MAI-004: Documentation:** Key architectural decisions and complex logic should be documented for developers.
*   **NFR-MAI-005: Configuration Management:** Configuration settings (e.g., API endpoints, cache durations) should be managed outside the codebase where possible (e.g., environment variables).

## 6. Data Management

### 6.1. Data Sources
*   **Primary External APIs:** As detailed in section 3.5 (Steam Web API, OpenDota API, Stratz API). These are the main sources for all dynamic Dota 2 game data.
*   **Game Client Files (Indirectly):** Some static data (like hero ability descriptions, base stats before patch-specific modifiers) might originate from game files, typically accessed via community-parsed repositories or APIs that process this data.
*   **Curated Content (Potentially):** For elements like "tips for playing a hero" or specific strategic advice, content might be manually curated if high-quality, structured data is not available via APIs. This would require a content management strategy.

### 6.2. Data Storage (Application-Side)
*   **Caching:** To minimize API calls, improve performance, and handle rate limits, a caching layer is essential. This could involve:
    *   Caching API responses for player profiles, match details, and hero data for a defined period.
    *   Using technologies like Redis or Memcached, or browser local storage for certain client-side caching.
*   **User Accounts (If Implemented):** If user accounts for personalization (e.g., saving favorite heroes, tracking specific players) are implemented, a database would be required to store user credentials, preferences, and linked Dota 2 accounts. For the MVP, user data storage might be minimal, primarily focused on session management and linking the Steam ID to application usage rather than extensive preference storage.
*   **No Replay Parsing/Storage:** The application will not download, store, or parse raw Dota 2 replay files itself due to their size and complexity. It will rely on external APIs for parsed match data.

### 6.3. Data Privacy
*   **Public Data:** The majority of the data displayed (player profiles, match history) is publicly available information from Dota 2 APIs.
*   **User-Provided Data:** If Steam authentication is used, the application will handle Steam IDs. Clear information should be provided to users about what data is being accessed (Steam ID, public persona name, avatar) and why (to enable login and display user info).
*   **API Keys:** API keys for external services must be stored securely and not exposed on the client-side.
*   **No Sensitive Personal Information:** The application will not require or store sensitive personal information beyond what is necessary for its core functionality (e.g., Steam ID for profile lookup and user identification).

## 7. Future Considerations
This section outlines potential features and enhancements that are not part of the initial MVP scope but could be considered for future development based on user feedback, resource availability, and strategic priorities.

### 7.1. User Authentication and Personalization
*   **Steam OpenID Login:** Allow users to log in with their Steam accounts. (This is now MVP)
*   **Personalized Dashboards:** Users could customize their dashboard to show specific information that matters most to them (e.g., tracked players, favorite heroes, specific stats).
*   **Saved Preferences:** Save user preferences for filters, display settings, etc.
*   **Private Notes/Annotations:** Allow users to add private notes to matches or player profiles.
*   **Match Tagging/Categorization:** Users could tag their own matches for better organization.

### 7.2. Advanced Match Analysis
*   **Detailed Event Logs:** Comprehensive logs of in-match events (rune pickups, smokes, buybacks, ward placements, creep score charts).
*   **Combat Logs Analysis:** Breakdown of damage sources, types, and targets in key fights.
*   **Laning Phase Analysis:** Performance metrics specific to the laning phase (e.g., last hits/denies at 10 mins, harass dealt/taken).
*   **Ward Maps:** Displaying ward placement locations and timings.
*   **Replay Parsing Integration (Ambitious):** Direct upload or linking of replay files for deeper, custom analysis if feasible and performant.

### 7.3. Live Match Tracking
*   **Professional Matches:** Track ongoing professional tournament matches with live scores, stats, and graphs.
*   **High-MMR Public Matches:** Allow users to watch ongoing high-level public games.
*   **User's Live Game (Requires Overwolf or similar):** If integrated with an in-game app platform, potentially provide live stats for a user's current game (this is a significant architectural addition).

### 7.4. Community and Social Features
*   **User-Generated Guides:** Allow experienced players to create and share hero guides, strategy articles, or item build suggestions.
*   **Commenting System:** Allow discussions on hero pages, match analyses, or guides.
*   **Rating System:** Users could rate guides or other community content.
*   **Forums/Discussion Boards:** Dedicated areas for community interaction.

### 7.5. Pro Player Insights
*   **Tracking Pro Players:** Easily follow specific professional players and their performance.
*   **Pro Player Build Aggregation:** Analyze common builds and skill progressions from professional matches.
*   **Tournament Data Integration:** Dedicated sections for major tournaments, showing brackets, results, and meta trends.

### 7.6. Push Notifications
*   **Tracked Player Updates:** Notify users when a tracked player completes a match.
*   **New Patch Information:** Alerts when significant game updates or new hero information is available.
*   **Major Tournament Alerts:** Notifications for upcoming or live important matches.

### 7.7. Enhanced Hero Comparison
*   Side-by-side comparison of stats, abilities, and win rates for multiple heroes.

### 7.8. Team Features
*   Allow users to create or track Dota 2 teams.
