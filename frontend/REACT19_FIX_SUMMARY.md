# React 19 "Element type is invalid" Fix Summary

## Issue
The application was throwing "Element type is invalid" errors specifically in the AnimatedRoutes component, with references to Fragment components.

## Root Cause
The project uses React 19.1.0, which has stricter requirements for imports and component exports. The main issues were:

1. **Mixed React import styles**: Some files were using `import React from 'react'` while React 19 prefers named imports
2. **LoadingSkeleton export issue**: The LoadingSkeleton component was exporting an object as default instead of a component
3. **Duplicate exports**: Named exports were being declared twice in LoadingSkeleton.jsx

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated React Imports
Changed all React imports from:
```javascript
import React from 'react';
```
To named imports:
```javascript
import { ComponentName } from 'react';
```

Files updated:
- `/src/App.jsx`
- `/src/main.jsx`
- `/src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx`
- All files in `/src/components/layout/`
- All files in `/src/pages/`
- `/src/components/LoadingSkeleton.jsx`
- `/src/components/RecommendationCard.jsx`

### 2. Fixed LoadingSkeleton Default Export
Changed from:
```javascript
export default {
  CardSkeleton,
  CardListSkeleton,
  // ... other exports
};
```

To:
```javascript
// Added a proper default component
const LoadingSkeleton = () => (
  <motion.div className="min-h-screen flex items-center justify-center">
    // ... loading UI
  </motion.div>
);

export default LoadingSkeleton;
```

### 3. Removed Duplicate Exports
Removed the duplicate named exports at the end of LoadingSkeleton.jsx since the components were already exported individually.

### 4. Simplified Route Structure
Moved Suspense boundaries inside individual routes instead of wrapping all Routes, improving error boundaries and component resolution.

## Result
- Build completes successfully
- Dev server runs without errors
- The "Element type is invalid" error is resolved

## Additional Notes
- React 19 has stricter ESM module requirements
- Always ensure default exports are actual components, not objects
- Named imports are preferred over namespace imports in React 19
