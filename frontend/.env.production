# Production environment variables for frontend-only deployment
# 
# IMPORTANT: For current frontend-only deployment, VITE_API_URL is NOT used
# The frontend connects directly to OpenDota API endpoints:
# - https://api.opendota.com/api/
#
# The following variable is commented out for frontend-only deployment:
# VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-on-railway.railway.app

# For future backend integration, uncomment and set VITE_API_URL to your backend URL:
# VITE_API_URL=https://your-deployed-backend.railway.app

# Current deployment uses direct OpenDota API integration
# No environment variables are required for frontend-only operation

# When backend is deployed in the future, you can:
# 1. Uncomment VITE_API_URL above
# 2. Set it to your deployed backend URL  
# 3. Update frontend code to use backend endpoints instead of direct API calls
# 4. Rebuild and redeploy the frontend

# Backend deployment options for future use:
# - Railway (recommended): https://railway.app
# - Vercel: https://vercel.com
# - Netlify Functions: https://netlify.com
# - Heroku: https://heroku.com
